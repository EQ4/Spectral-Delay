# Spectral-Delay

### What is this?

A spectral delay is a sound effect that applies a different delay to different frequency bands. To hear an example of how this works, run spectralDelayTest.m. To use your own audio as imput and have control over the parameters, use spectralDelay.m. There is also a simple spectrum analyzer included as a helper for the test function.

Enjoy!
